# VLM Notebooks

A curated collection of Jupyter notebooks for exploring Vision Language Models (VLMs).

## Purpose

This repository aims to provide a comprehensive set of exploratory notebooks to help researchers, developers, and enthusiasts understand and experiment with Vision Language Models. The notebooks cover various aspects of VLMs including:

- Model inference and evaluation
- Fine-tuning and training methodologies
- Performance benchmarking and optimization
- Practical applications and use cases

## Notebook Categories

### Inference
Notebooks demonstrating how to run inference with popular VLMs:
- Model loading and setup
- Prompt engineering for vision tasks
- Batch processing and efficiency techniques

### Training
Notebooks covering training and fine-tuning VLMs:
- Data preparation and preprocessing
- Fine-tuning strategies
- Training monitoring and evaluation

### Applications
Example applications and use cases:
- Image captioning and understanding
- Visual question answering
- Multimodal reasoning tasks

## Getting Started

Each notebook is designed to be self-contained with clear instructions and dependencies listed at the beginning.
